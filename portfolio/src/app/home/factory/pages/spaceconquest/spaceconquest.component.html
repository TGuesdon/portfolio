<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
    To conquier another planet you'll have to send spaceships on it. You also can choose the amount of spaceships sent (in %). To win a game you need to take every planets belonging to users, it is not necessary to take all neutral planets. You cannot send too much spaceships at a time, so when you try to send a lot of spaceships they will be withdrawn from your spaceships and sent periodically in waves if there is no allied spaceships in orbit.
