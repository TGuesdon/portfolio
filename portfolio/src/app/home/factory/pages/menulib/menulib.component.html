<p>
    MenuLib is a web application which allows customers to order at the restaurant with a Qr Code. Its main difference with similar application is that the Qr Code is displayed on a screen and changed after each utilisation. This protect toward any malicious possibility.

<h2 class="first">Project Manager</h2>

<p>
    My first role on this project was a supervisor role, I helped Idealtek Concept to write their specifications and made contact with Paul, Louis and Thomas. I had to verify that they completed our expectation during the project, and was their main contact at Idealtek Concept.
</p>

<p>
    They delivered the application in time with all the asked functionnalities.

<h4>Preparer panel</h4>

</p>

<h4>Customer panel</h4>

<p>
    A view used to browse all articles and categories, with a cart that can be validated so the order goes to the kitchen.
</p>

<h2>Developper</h2>
<p>
    After getting the V1 from Louis, Paul and Thomas, I switched back to a developper role. We showed our application to some potential client to get some insights on what to improve next.
</p>
<p>
    I did a full visual reworking to get a more "sellable" visual, with the addition of new themes for caf√© and pizzeria. This is also when we decided to use a Qr Code displayed on screen that change after each use. I added this functionnality along with a number id for the orders.
